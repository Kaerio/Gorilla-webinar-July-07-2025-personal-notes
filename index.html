      <h2>Personal opinion on the webinar</h2>
      <p>
        <li>
          Clear to me that they are restricted to give too much details about
          what is going on.
        </li>
        <li>
          @ 37:00 Bruce was restricted to mention more about an opportunity by
          Jay and Bruce answered ‚ÄúYeah, not going to give any more details about
          it‚Äù. They were talking about bid and performance bonds as ‚Äúentry fee‚Äù.
          And a contract where they need to deploy $55M to perform...
        </li>
      </p>

      <h2>Notes</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Pipeline :</strong> $5.6 billion / 87 active opportunities.
          (personal note: Thailand PEA project not included anymore as already
          in Proof-of-Concept phase (POC) as told last month)
        </li>
        <li>
          1.3B of that is targeted for closure by mid-2026. These are
          multi-years contracts, the shortest is 3 years and the longest is 15
          years.
        </li>
        <li>
          Several projects in Thailand and Taiwan are expected to reach signing
          before August 15th.
        </li>
        <li>
          Large government contracts 5-10 years long like national security
          infrastructure, education, critical law enforcement, are subject to
          parliament and cabinet reviews. It is impossible and irresponsible to
          predict the exact day for signing the contract.<br />
          But Gorilla is already deeply embedded as a strategic partner in that.
        </li>
        <li>
          The company is always thinking about shareholders but also have
          customers needing national scale outcomes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Need to manage shareholder value + customer's trust + employee growth
          for long term resilience.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Bringing high caliber people:</strong> see on LinkedIn for
          exemple all the awesome employee profiles they hired this year. Their
          profiles are exceptional.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Smart education project:</strong> Final stage of commercial
          negotiations for the project in Thailand. About educating 6.5 million
          students! First phase of a multi-year, even multi-decade program.
        </li>
        <li>
          Smart hospitals in Thailand: advancing well. Finalizing detailed
          commercial models.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>PEA Smart Grid project:</strong> One of the largest national
          energy initiatives in Thailand/Asia today. Currently in
          Proof-of-Concept stage. It will advance in technical/commercial
          discussions. Further updates will come on a regular basis for each
          meaningful development.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>One Amazon:</strong> It has progressed massively in the past
          quarter. Official launch of the platform at New York Climate Week this
          September with their first tokenized environmental assets ready to
          roll out by COP 30 in November. Closing final funding grants with some
          of largest institutions/banks in the world and sovereign wealth funds.
          Lot of interest to back this. Building Proof-of-Concept of complete
          baseline mapping of hundreds of thousands of hectares + laying
          critical groundwork with state governments. Signing or signed up in
          few of the 9 countries where they are going to deploy the technology.
          Raj and R&D team are pushing to finalize the AI system for carbon and
          biodiversity verification. Racing to deploy satellite and ground
          sensor networks for initial POC ahead of COP 30. Project is moving
          fast. Expect revenues starting to come from Q4 2025
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>HPE:</strong> advancing on large scale initiatives with HPE:
          secure data centers, AI appliances, fully integrated infrastructure
          platforms for governments and enterprise clients. The partnership
          gives world-class hardware and credibility that accelerate trust for
          projects about national infrastructure.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Solution Provider for Nvidia:</strong> Big advantage for video
          analytics, deep learning models and large-scale orchestration. It was
          needed to build Gorilla platform.<br />
          => Asbolutly go see the rest of infos at the end of Q&A section
          <a href="#nvidia">here</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          Going to launch a hyperscaler to host a lot of the satellite data so
          the environmental data can sit in the USA.
        </li>
        <li>
          The ecosystem is backed by HPE infrastructure capabilities and Nvidia
          AI leadership.
        </li>
        <li>
          Formally launched the funds. First one is renamed in ‚ÄúTerostrata‚Äù (not
          sure about the spelling) => deployed 3.5B in assets + big cash
          position. The 2nd secured $1B term sheet. In the final stage of
          closing a term sheet for another $1B. They will be used for strategic
          deployments.
        </li>
        <li>
          Will use OPEX model for clients instead of CAPEX burden. Much more
          attractive.
        </li>
        <li>Now in advanced engagement with a key province in USA.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Offering: Raised $105M</h2>
      <p>
        Projects needs a bid bond (3-5% of project value) and a performance bond
        (5-7% of project value). Ex: A project of 400M need between $20M and
        $40M‚Ä¶ <br />
        Type of projects Gorilla work on require showing substantial balance
        sheet to be able to win them. You need to show the money if you want to
        win. <br />
        Will be used to sign things in the pipeline that are signable in the
        next couple of months. <br />
        Timeline accelerated for a couple of these contracts. Debt would take
        too much time. The debt lined up would not complete in time to
        realistically take on the project. So they raised equity to be able to
        confidently sign the project. And also, to be able to execute if more
        project come up into the pripeline. <br />
        As they said before, they had adequate funding for the project already
        signed. Some projects became larger and shorter dated. Next 3 months
        will vindicate this decision as we will see what they are doing and what
        the funds will be used for.<br />
        Still committed to 1st :project level funding, secondly debt financing,
        and thirdly if needed equity funding. Already lined up plenty of project
        financing like funds from One Apazon and ‚ÄúTerostrata‚Äù.<br />
        Sold 1.45M treasury shares in the offering that they accumulated past
        year and issued 1.05M new shares. The rest is prefunded warrants
        (investor prepaid the full cash for warrants and will be able to
        exercise for shares at his discretion if/when they need to sell them).
        <br />
        They are very happy how this worked out. <br />
        Investors asked to not disclose his name for now.
        <strong
          >They are a very well respected fundamental portfolio investor, and it
          is not a sovereign wealth fund.</strong

      </p>

      <h2>More notes</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Debt:</strong> secured satisfactory term sheets for up to
          $200M. The timeline is not weeks like equity fund raise; it is months.
        </li>
        <li>
          Raising equity enables Gorilla to get into the projects and makes debt
          easier to get (pricing, service)
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>$108M as total cash on balance sheet as of today. </strong>
          already used as bid bonds, performance bonds etc, to secure contracts
          in the pipeline in the near term. Over $80M of free cash to use for
          more bids and garantees for projects, and funding the performance on
          those contracts.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Debt coming down to $16.5M (at 3% interest rate).</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Building in Taiwan</strong> still on the market. It would
          repaid the loan if sold.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Q2 results:</strong> target for release is around mid-August
          (not a deadline guys Bruce told around this date)
        </li>
        <li>
          Priority for funding business is focused on raising debt or preferred
          equity (similar to debt). Engaging with bank(s) to arrange this. It
          will be announced if/when needed to secure contracts.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Q & A</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Offering</strong>: See above.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Status of the $50M influx:</strong> Not yet received. Some
          invoices were delayed in terms of when they could be issued. On $25M
          that were invoiced, they received about $10M as of now. A bit
          disappointing, but tied to Governments‚Ä¶ sometimes you need to be
          patient. (I worked at local Government level and it‚Äôs true, there is
          often delay but it‚Äôs ‚Äúnormal‚Äù and certainty to get paid is higher with
          Government IMO)
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Warrants:</strong> after the reverse split they were adjusted
          to 958K warrants, strike price is $115 a share. (some investors still
          doubt the infos is correct in Stocktwits about the 10:1 ratio, maybe
          confirmation should be asked to company about it)
        </li>
        <li>
          20% Insider ownership: As a FPI Gorilla is not required to file form
          4. (They could have filed 6K in my opinion)
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Sustain 40 to 45% gross margin on large projects?</strong> Yes
          because Gorilla owns much of the stack itself. Not at the mercy of
          endless chain of contractors. Building recurring revenues. As projects
          grow they find innovative ways to build up even more the margins.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Margin expectation on new contracts ?</strong> Moving away
          from the old contracts style on the current negotiations (smart
          policing, national education, sovereign data‚Ä¶). Target 40-45% margin,
          and also providing CAPEX for customers. Project implementation also
          are about base od devices and software licences that support gross
          margins.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>2026 guidance?</strong> will give credible guidance locked in
          by signed contracts and not fantasy. When project are closed in next
          quarters, especially One Amazon and Smart Education projects,
          significant revenues will begin to generate in Q4. They will issue
          multi year guidance at that point, either with Q4 numbers or early Q1
          next year.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Pipeline breakdown?</strong> $5.6B across 87 opportunities.
          $1.3B expected to be sign between now and 2nd quarter 2026. Spread
          across SEA, Latin America, Middle East and USA. Geographical balance.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Pilots turned into customers?</strong> Yes, pilots or
          Proof-of-Concept for past 6-8 months have actually grown to full paid
          customers.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>US Government and public sector opportunities?</strong> Yes.
          Working on key province on the East Coast. Working on 5G lawful
          interception solutions for Government agencies in US. Lining up
          sizable US Infrastructure deals for later half of 2025. Takes but time
          but should show significant announcement over the next months.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>SEA Smart City Government contracts?</strong> currently
          engaged in 5 or 6 major contracts in SEA. They hope to sign them by
          mid-August.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Thai acquisition?</strong> remain on track to close this
          quarter. Team is already operational and in place for leadership and
          execution quality positioning Gorilla for rapid scale development when
          it‚Äôs signed. This company have brought Gorilla in very significant
          deals in this region.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Plan for M&A or joint ventures?</strong> Hands full for next
          few months with customers and M&A project in Thailand that comes with
          a full team of 70 people allowing to rapidly scale in SEA region.
          There will be then two big offices (Taiwan, and Thailand) both with
          R&D team and then with a team that can do the customer facing work.
          They have now access trough partners and private funds to more than
          15-20B dollars of capital. They love good deal and undervalued assets
          that they could ‚ÄúGorillize‚Äù(use, lol) and scale.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>legal action status and tentative of settlement?</strong>
          paased the case against Culper in order to pursue settlement
          negotiations. It‚Äôs almost over and the result is good for the company.
        </li>
        <li id="nvidia">
          <strong>Nvidia partnership?</strong> Massive accelerator for Gorilla.
          Not about prestige or name. Directly power the next phase of
          infrastructure strategy. Customer demand shifted from generic computes
          to high performance. Nvidia plaforms allows engineering exactly what
          Gorilla needs.<br />
          Quote from Jay from the transcript:<br />
          <blockquote>
            ‚ÄúCompact edge devices that don't just see, they decide. Our
            proprietary IP from multi-person tracking to anomaly detection and
            complex object recognition now runs optimized on Nvidia's
            accelerated edge compute. Now this is not a simple model port. We
            are rearchitecting our entire AI pipeline for Nvidia's compute
            fabric. It means tighter CUDA kernel integration, tensor RT
            acceleration and full stack profiling all translating this does for
            us is actually strengthening our roadmap from Guerilla intelligent
            network director. All of you know about our SD-WAN solution to our
            new AI video analytics appliance. Everything is now designed for a
            groundup AI acceleration. Now for example there's one Amazon. We are
            not just drawing pretty satellite maps. We are training
            biomespecific language models on fused satellite and IoT ground
            data. Nvidia's GPUs are the only practical way to train and infer at
            scale. Now their developer ecosystem for example and their SDK stack
            like the Deep Stream and Triton give us a genuine force multiplier.
            The bottom line for us is that we are shifting Guerilla from a
            traditional compute to what is called you know what for me a rocket
            shaped AI native infrastructure. faster, smarter, everywhere from
            edge to cloud. This is how we will stay ahead of customer demand.
            Own the technical conversation and more importantly turn ideas into
            operational reality. So it is not fluff, it is serious guerilla
            progress.‚Äù
